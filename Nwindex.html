        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A lifelong enthusiast of computers and technology, I find myself constantly drawn to the ever-evolving digital landscape.  When I'm not immersed in the world of code or exploring new software, you'll likely find me on the cricket field, either playing or cheering on my favorite team.  Balancing my tech interests and sporting passions with a healthy dose of wanderlust, I love to travel and experience new cultures, always eager to explore different corners of the globe and broaden my horizons.</p>

          <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
          <p>This project involved building a responsive e-commerce website using the Bootstrap framework. I utilized Bootstrap's grid system to create a dynamic product listing page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.  Initially, I struggled with understanding how Bootstrap's grid worked, but through practice and by consulting the documentation, I was able to master it.  I also gained experience in customizing Bootstrap's default styling using CSS overrides to match the client's branding guidelines.  Integrating Bootstrap's form components with my backend logic for handling user registrations was another valuable learning experience.  This project reinforced the importance of mobile-first design, as Bootstrap's responsive framework made it easy to prioritize the mobile experience.  <a href="https://github.com/manishmukund91/bootstrap4_project/blob/main/mybootstrapproject.html">Link to project</a></p>

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>This project involved building a responsive website for a local bakery using HTML and CSS. I focused on creating a visually appealing design that showcases their delicious products. I learned how to use flexbox to create a flexible and adaptable layout for the homepage, and I implemented media queries to ensure the website looks great on all devices.  One challenge I faced was creating a visually appealing image gallery, but I overcame this by learning about CSS grid and its ability to create dynamic layouts.  This project reinforced the importance of writing clean and well-structured HTML and CSS code <a href="https://github.com/manishmukund91/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/Assignment.html">Link to project</a></p>
